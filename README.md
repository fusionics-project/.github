# fusionics-project

This organisation has been created as a space for collaboration on fusionics components.

Definition : Fusionics is to Fusion as Avionics is to Aerospace

In this context, Fusion means fusion energy.  The roots of fusionics come from magnetic confinement fusion (MCF).
MCF control systems have some requirements which are not immediately met by commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) tools.

There are a number of custom solutions which have been developed through fusion research and development.
The goal of the fusionics concept in general, and this fusionics-project collection of repositories in 
particular is to standardise, popularise, and democratise access to these solutions.  It is also expected
that in doing this, additional innovation will generate new components, techniques and tools.

# Fusion Controls Software Community

Many of the projects in this space are inspired by and supported via contributions from many fusion researchers
and other people from labs, academia and companies.  All repositories which derive from these earlier works will
credit the original authors, cross reference upstream repositories, and cite any accompanying licensing conditions.

Any potential contributors are encouraged to discuss with the project coordinator what IP issues need to be considered
before adding to this collection of projects.

# Project Coordinator

This github organisation has been created by Adam Stephen, a fusion researcher working at Culham.  
It contains work in progress which is intended to be released back to upstream projects 
where appropriate, or released as new projects. For any queries about repositories in this
collection, please contact mailto:adam.v.stephen@gmail.com

# Repository Workflows and Practices

The long term intent for all repositories in this github organisation is for them to become public, and generally
open source.  During the early development stages, repositories will be kept private until the maturity of the 
code and quality of the documentation is adequate to justify sharing.  Where appropriate, developments in this
space which derive from existing projects will be used to form pull requests in the case that the upstream
projects have the bandwith to accept contributions.  In some cases, this organisation will form a temporary
home for community quality contributions to be maintained until such time as the upstream official releases
(owned by organisations) are able to adopt and redistribute such works.

# UKAEA Interests

This collection of repositories has been created by Adam Stephen who contributes to this area
as part of his employment contract with the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, and also
as volunteer effort where contributing specifically to MARTe2 projects.

Some of the repositories in this collection are being developed with research funding from
UKAEA programmes.  Funding and IP terms will be clarified in the README and LICENSE files for
each such repository.  Where work achieves a degree of maturity and quality to qualify for
official release via the UKAEA github account, it will be migrated.

The opinions in this space do not officially represent the position of the UKAEA.
